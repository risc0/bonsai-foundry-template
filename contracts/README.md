# Solidity Contracts

This directory contains the Solidity contract for deploying an application with [RISC Zero] on Ethereum.
There are two primary starter template contracts included.

<!-- TODO: Change this link once the new repo is live -->

The Solidity libraries for Bonsai can be found at [github.com/risc0/risc0](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/main/bonsai/ethereum).

Contracts are built and tested with [forge], which is part of the [Foundry] toolkit.
Tests are defined in the `tests` directory in the root of this template.
